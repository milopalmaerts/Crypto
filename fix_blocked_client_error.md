# Fix ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT Error - Browser Solutions

## Quick Test Solutions:

1. **Disable Ad Blocker temporarily**
   - Right-click on ad blocker extension (uBlock Origin, AdBlock, etc.)
   - Select "Disable on this site" or "Pause on this site"
   - Refresh the page

2. **Try Incognito/Private Mode**
   - Open your app in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N)
   - This disables most extensions automatically

3. **Alternative localhost address**
   - Try http://127.0.0.1:3001 instead of http://localhost:3001
   - Some ad blockers treat these differently

4. **Whitelist localhost in ad blocker**
   - Add localhost:* to your ad blocker's whitelist
   - Add 127.0.0.1:* to the whitelist as well

## Browser-Specific Solutions:

### Chrome:
1. Go to chrome://settings/content/
2. Add localhost:* to allowed sites

### Firefox:
1. about:config
2. Search for "network.dns.disableIPv6"
3. Set to true if currently false

### Edge:
1. Edge settings > Cookies and site permissions
2. Add localhost to allowed sites
